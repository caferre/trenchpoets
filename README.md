# Historical Background

Sexuality and gender in the First World War are often studied as it had incredibly destabilizing effects, especially on masculinity. A lack of men at home prompted women to enter the workforce beyond secretarial and white-collar jobs. Shell-shock, physical disabilities, and death prevented men from returning to their old lives after the war, and some soldiers held bitter resentment towards civilians, especially women, for lauding the image of a brave soldier from their relative safety at home. Husbands felt isolated and deeply changed, and wives found them unreachable. During the war, men were separated from their families and the kind of emotional support they had received, mostly from their wives, so they formed close bonds with other men in their squadrons. This need for connection allowed queer soldiers to express their love for their comrades with a level of ambiguity. Trench poets occupy a central role in the study of gender and sexuality in the First World War. Their often scathing notes on the war and horrific descriptions of what they saw have served to cement them in historical and literary analysis of this period. A not insignificant subsection of trench poets were also queer, and their lives provide insight into a queer world in early 20th century United Kingdom. Among these, Siegfried Sassoon is one of the most iconic.

## Existing literature on WWI, gender, and sexuality 

Existing scholarship has focused intensely on the destabilization of masculinity during the war. That World War I threw the traditional gender norms of many European countries into disarray is not a new concept. As early as the 1920s, in fact, members of the British public were concerned with the “painted boy,” queer men in London, “because he embodied particular historical fears and anxieties related to the experience of the First World War” which “emasculated and feminized” men.[^1] Homosexuality had been a concern to the British for centuries, with the earliest anti queer law being passed in 1533 as a statute against buggery, and the most recent one prior to the war written in 1898. Masculinity was a matter of concern during the war and later became a matter of interest, but it has always been a point of focus. Modern scholars have less worries about an effeminate male scourge and instead tend to examine what happened to masculinity and why. The study of queerness during World War I is also not a new concept, however, it is far younger than studies of gender. In the past thirty or so years, more and more work has been published on specifically the queerness of famous trench poets and how their poetry and personal writings reflect that.

Jason Crouthamel is a significant scholar of queerness in WWI whose work does not focus only on either trench poets or Western European soldiers. His works on German soldiers are particularly helpful for their illumination of the social world of the trenches, and although they are about the opposing army, the observations of camaraderie and closeness as a response to the horrors they were experiencing can easily be applied to the British army as well. Adrian Caesar’s Taking it Like a Man explores the suffering, sacrifice, and sexuality of the war poets and is incredibly useful for studying how poets reconciled their more intellectual, aesthetic tendencies with the extreme violence they did every day. In a similar vein, James Campbell’s essay on the ethics of passivity details the gendered politics of a battalion, which formed largely around class, rank, and racial divisions. Despite being neither explicitly for historians nor about World War I, Eve Sedgwick’s writings on homosociality and homosocial desire are crucial for exploring queerness in the trenches. In her definition the word homosocial
       <blockquote>
       “describes social bonds between persons of the same sex; it is a neologism, obviously formed by analogy with "homosexual," and just as obviously meant to be distinguished from "homosexual." In fact, it is applied to such activities as "male bonding," which may, as in our society, be characterized by intense homophobia, fear and hatred of homosexuality. To draw the "homosocial" back into the orbit of "desire," of the potentially erotic, then, is to hypothesize the potential unbrokenness of a continuum between homosocial and homosexual– a continuum whose visibility, for men, in our society, is radically disrupted.”[^2]
       </blockquote>
       
This joining, or rejoining, of homosociality with desire, with eroticism– it is part and parcel with the work being done in World War I among queer and heterosexual soldiers alike.

## Siegfried Sassoon

A perfect example of the intersections between masculinity and sexuality is Siegfried Sassoon. Sassoon was born September 8, 1886 in Kent, England. His father was part of the wealthy Baghdadi and Jewish Sassoon merchant family; his mother was Catholic and part of a well-known family of sculptors. When Sassoon was a young child, his parents divorced quite bitterly and his father died when Sassoon was only nine. Sassoon’s mother played a prominent role in Sassoon’s early life and the two remained in close contact until her death in 1947.

The Sassoons were an upper-class family, part of British high society, and Sassoon was raised accordingly. He attended a private school where he “was taught notions of Christian good and evil which were mixed with imperialist notions of heroism.”[^3] He would convert to Catholicism later in life, and distanced himself from his Jewish heritage. This private school education laid the foundations for his complicated relationship with self-sacrifice and martyrdom, as well as his harsh judgments of both himself and others. His adoption of a sportsman persona, a fox-hunting gentleman one might say, in order to please his family and his school friends warred against his ‘true’ nature; Sassoon enjoyed time in isolation where he could write poetry and muse about the world.

Siegfried joined the army in 1914 with the Royal Welch Fusiliers’ 1st Battalion, who were present for parts of the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917; two of the most brutal conflicts on the Western Front. As gentility, Sassoon was one of the first batch of recruits to enlist purposely as this was well before the draft was instituted and before the nightmares of the war became clear. Serving in the war was both a duty to honor, and a chance to prove oneself. Sassoon, like many other upper-class soldiers, became an officer although he viewed this position with some scorn and certainly disdained other members of the officer class.

# Research Question

What does Sassoon’s description, in both his diaries and the Sherston memoirs, of his relationship with fellow soldier David Thomas say of the blurred lines between homosociality and homosexuality in the British Armed Forces during the First World War and the way queer men may have employed that uncertainty? What might one conclude it reveals about Sassoon’s feelings of his own sexuality?

## Trying to answer a gap in the scholarship

Many writers have focused on Sassoon’s relationship with Robert Graves, another queer war poet who Sassoon was very close to, as an example of his queerness during wartime. Others still have looked at the mentor role he took on with Wilfred Owen to study how these queer poets found and supported each other. But very few delve deep into Sassoon and Tommy. Perhaps it is the ambiguity of Tommy’s own sexuality as it is not known whether he was queer or not, or perhaps because he was a regular footsoldier (although he did eventually become a lieutenant). He did not come from particularly glorious backgrounds, nor did he write some of the most iconic poems about WWI. From a purely logistical standpoint, there is simply less information about him, making him a less researchable figure. However, Tommy’s importance to Sassoon and the impact his death had on him can not be overstated.

Analyzing this relationship opens up interesting avenues with which to explore homosexual relationships across class and military rank. The queer culture of London had been practically booming before the war, as urban developments gave wealthier queer men places to congregate and made it easier to find communities. In fact, “for many upper and upper-middle class men the opportunities offered by the cosmopolitan West End were supplemented by a tradition of homosociality which often protected them in their sexual exploits.”[^4] This tradition of homosociality was the gentleman persona and culture which was inherently exclusionary of women, and men not of their standing or race, and which gave these men, nearly required them, to form close bonds with other men. When war broke out, upper class men were among the first to willingly enlist, as they could often be granted officership and given the chance to prove their mettle in combat. War proved to be a similar space where a tradition of homosociality protected, somewhat, the queer men who moved within it. Queer soldiers felt they could be more open about their sexuality because the environment was already fostering same sex relationships,[^5] expounded by a need for emotional support and intimacy that could no longer be provided by their wives.[^6]

Sassoon was an officer, and men of the officer-class served a unique role for those in their unit. When it came to the ways soldiers and officers expressed affection for each other, officers had an even more complicated sentiment. They seemingly saw themselves as a “mother and lover of his men” because their higher rank placed them in a caregiving role, and that role had typically been associated with femininity.[^7]  In order to deal with the traumas they were undergoing and removed from their usual systems of care, “many soldiers openly embraced feminine feelings of familial love and nurturing in the trenches”[^8] acting more affectionately and forming close bonds. For this reason, his relationship with Tommy, one of the men under his care essentially, serves as further means to explore the inter-class bonds and separations of trench life as well as the ways in which class affected how queerness could be felt and expressed.

# Primary Sources
## _Diaries 1915-1918_

Sassoon kept a diary fairly religiously for most of his life. His son, George Sassoon, released the diaries bit by bit after his father’s passing, and as recently as 2009 George granted permission for a huge collection of papers to be digitized. The amount of records is truly immense, not least because from 1905 to about 1959, Sassoon wrote almost every day. His time in the army is no exception, even when he was stationed on parts of the Western Front where fighting was some of the thickest. However, there are some major discrepancies. The 1983 collection of his diaries from 1915-1918 notes that there are no diaries for the entirety of his time at Craiglockhart,[^9] the military psychiatric hospital he was committed to after his inflammatory anti-war letter nearly got him court-martialed and tried for treason. In fact, immediately after he sent the letter to his Commanding Officer on July 6, 1917, the entries stopped. They resumed nearly five months later, on December 19th. It is unclear what happened to these entries, whether they were destroyed, “lost,” omitted from the publication by Sassoon or his estate, or if they never existed at all. This is by far the most substantial missing period, although it is not the only time the diaries were altered or otherwise lost. Names were scratched out or carefully avoided, and sometimes whole pages were torn out.[^10] From August 12, 1916 to December 22, 1916 there are again no entries. Sometime during this period, Sassoon discovered that Robert Graves, presumed killed in action, was in fact alive and the two spent an unknown amount of time convalescing together while they recovered from their injuries.[^12] Any time that Sassoon breaks his routine is worth noting, as it implies something disrupted him and the sense of normality he worked to maintain. The ambiguity of his diary is both complemented and exacerbated in his recounting of these events via memoirs he wrote in the 1930s.

## _The Complete Memoirs of George Sherston_

Despite his great popularity as a writer, Sassoon would not publish an autobiography of his time in the war until 1945. However, he published a lightly fictionalized recounting of events in a three-book series entitled the Memoirs of George Sherston. These books follow Sherston (the stand in for Sassoon) through his life leading up to the war and through to its end. Many of the figures in Sassoon’s diaries appear in the memoirs under different names, and some passages are almost verbatim taken from his diaries. Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man, the first book in the series, was published in 1928, and it deals primarily with Sassoon’s society life before the war, as well as his training and initial deployment to the Front, going up until April 1916. In 1930, he published Memoirs of an Infantry Officer, which covers his time on the Western Front and elsewhere between 1916 and mid 1917. Sherston’s Progress, the third book in the series, is the closest to a diary of Sassoon’s time in Craiglockhart as is known. It begins with a chapter entitled “Rivers” after Doctor W.H.R. Rivers, Sassoon’s primary doctor in the hospital and eventual close friend. It details Sassoon’s experiences during his inpatient care, but interestingly, Robert Graves and Wilfred Owen, someone Sassoon would take a mentorship role for, are mentioned sparingly, despite the two men’s importance to Sassoon. Due to the detail of this section and its stylistic similarity to the other memoirs, which in turn heavily mirror Sassoon’s diaries, it seems likely that Sassoon did, in fact, keep a diary for his time with Rivers. The far more relevant question is not did he keep a diary from July 7th to December 18th, but why was it omitted from the published version, and why was it written back in for the memoirs.

## Usage and Relevance

Looking at the diary and the memoirs combined allows for an examination of Sassoon’s self-censorship. Comparing the content in the two, in a way checking them against each other, sheds light on what aspects of his life Sassoon was comfortable sharing and exploring at different times. The memoirs are certainly personal and intimate, however there is some limitation of Sassoon’s feelings that are not rage and sorrow about the war generally speaking. When his friends are killed, Sassoon as Sherston is able to control the emotions he feels. If something is too raw, perhaps too complicated in his mind for audience’s to understand, he tones it down or alters it slightly. Rupert Hart-Davis, editor of Sassoon’s diaries, writes that “[Sassoon] longed for praise and recognition, but he was so instinctively reclusive”[^13] that he published many poems and Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man anonymously at first. He was very careful in how he presented himself to the world and it’s unclear how much of that was due to his innate solitary tendencies, his socialization in British high society, famously very reserved, or a response to his queerness, a fact of himself which he never truly accepted writing in a letter from 1949 that “the whole point of life is ‘to try [and] rise above one’s waistline’”[^14]

Of all the figures in these texts, the most useful for studying Sassoon’s relationship with his sexuality are Robert Graves and David “Tommy” Thomas. In the memoirs, Robert Graves becomes David Cromlech and Tommy becomes Dick Tiltwood. It is with these two people that discrepancies between the texts are particularly obvious. Graves and Sassoon write to each other almost constantly, sending each other snippets of their poetry, talking about their experiences at the front, and their lives more generally. They also spend a significant amount of time together when the two are on leave at the same time. Yet, in the Sherston memoirs, the character of David Cromlech is practically nonexistent. This may be due to a possible falling out Graves and Sassoon had after Graves’ marriage, making Sassoon less inclined to include him when he wrote the memoirs several years after the fact. It may also be due to the very fact of their closeness and frequent correspondence being a potential risk if the two wished to dissuade discussion of their sexualities.

Moving on from Robert Graves, there is the character of Tommy. David Cuthbert Thomas, nicknamed Tommy, was born in 1895 in a small, rural Welsh town, and not much is known of his life except his parent’s names and that he went to Christ College in Brecon before enlisting. He was assigned to the same regiment and battalion as Sassoon, and Graves, and the two quickly became good friends despite their distance in age, class, and rank.

# A Deeper Look
## Sassoon and Tommy

Sassoon’s diaries talk at length about Tommy and, while Tommy’s character in the Sherston memoirs is important, there is nowhere near the same level of sorrow as on Sassoon’s part when Tommy dies in the memoirs. In the diaries, Sassoon is distraught. He misses a large chunk of entries, which is not unheard of for him to do but is certainly unusual, and he mentions Tommy far more frequently. The fact that the fictionalized memoirs sterilize this agony Sassoon experienced is interesting. Sassoon was not one to shy away from describing the depression, anxiety, and trauma he felt during the war– in fact it was what made him so famous. So, there must have been a reason Sasson felt he should hide the intensity of this specific relationship. 

Based on the plethora of times Sassoon describes Tommy as handsome, and kind, and the best part of being at the Front or in training, it seems likely that, at least on Sassoon’s part, there was a care beyond platonic affection and camaraderie. Tommy’s first mention in Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man is given a softness in a way. Sassoon writes that “[h]e had the obvious good looks which go with fair hair and firm features, but it was the radiant integrity of his expression which astonished me.”[^15] Although Sassoon was practically obsessed with the image of a British country youth, and he certainly projected that idolization onto Tommy, there is an element of adoration and affection as well. Idolization of virile youth was not unique to Sassoon, and characterizes some of the classical texts which would have been studied in a majority of English private schools. These texts, in which “an ideal is made of beautiful male youth self-sacrificed in battle,”[^16] shaped how people thought of the quote unquote common soldiers during the war. Sassoon especially holds them in high esteem, and he writes about them frequently in his poems. Tommy is the subject of at least three of Sassoon’s poems, and likely more.[^17] After this first description, he goes on to say that Tommy and him spent ample time together and his camp life was much improved by the other’s presence. It was known that Sassoon held a, sometimes mythological, image of the British countryside and its strapping young men in high esteem as he had written about it before in a number of his poems. That may have given him the cover to remark on this man which he loved, platonically or otherwise, in more romantic terms.

Tommy is Sassoon’s reason to carry on at times. For most of the war, Sassoon seriously struggled with the intense horrors he witnessed and flirted with suicidality. He met Tommy before the soul-crushing ennui had really set in for the first time, but he was still working to prepare himself for what he considered the eventuality of his death, yet Tommy complicated things. When he first arrived at the Front, realities started to set in and he began to understand how precarious his situation was “[b]ut even then it wasn’t easy to think of dying…Still less so when Dick was with me.”[^18] In context, it seems that Sassoon is referring to Tommy’s ability to remind him of his fox-hunting days, and this is certainly a large part of it, but Sassoon also says that Tommy is his bright spot before this. Whether or not his love for Tommy was romantic or not, he is able to express it more openly than would be expected because of the nature of the war. Men needed emotional support and intimacy and they could not find it with women, who were too far away and could not understand the horrors of war, so they turned to other men.[^19]

Sadly, Tommy was killed in action on March 19th, 1916. Sassoon’s diaries do not hold back on his anguish. Tommy is mentioned frequently over the next handful of entries, and Sassoon’s mood takes a rather dour turn. He doesn’t write for nearly a week, and when he resumes it is clear that he’s struggling. On March 26th, he muses on the weather and the dreary scenery and on returning home– and he ends his entry with “[a]nd Tommy’s dead.”[^20] It’s one of the most vulnerable entries at this point in the diary, expressing the intensity of Sassoon’s grief in his uncharacteristic succinctness. The suicidal ideations no longer have a reason to be tempered and Sassoon begins putting himself into increasingly dangerous situations, and behaving with little to no regard for his own life. “They say I am trying to get myself killed. Am I? I don’t know,”[^21] he notes on April 11th, a little under a month after Tommy’s death. Sassoon’s devastation at losing Tommy and the utter bleakness of the world afterwards is not owed entirely to the bond between them, but to the youthful hope that Tommy represented. Through a rather interesting coincidence, “Tommy” happens to be the nickname given to British soldiers as a whole in World War I and David Thomas, at least in Sassoon’s memory of him, truly exemplifies that young and common soldier who held the weight of the nation. When he dies, it is as though Britain’s hope dies with him. It is possible, however, that the depth of this idolization is either a purposeful attempt at obscuring Sassoon’s deep love for his friend and the closest he can get to loving him openly, or an unconscious expression of his intense affection that placed Tommy upon a pedestal.

## Sassoon and Graves

Another of Sassoon’s close friends was Robert Graves. The two frequently wrote to each other and had a flirtatious correspondence at times. Like Tommy, however, Graves is mentioned far less in the memoirs. He appears at much more of a distance than expected given the close relationship the two can be seen to have in Sassoon’s diaries. Graves was the person who persuaded Sassoon to go before a medical panel after his inflammatory anti-war letter and claim or convince them he was suffering from shell-shock, so as to avoid execution for treason. Near the end of 1917, Graves gives Sassoon “his apologies for his engagement to Miss [Nancy] Nicholson,”[^22] a woman Graves had met some time ago and apparently carried out a courtship with. He is mentioned less frequently for the rest of the entries, which go until armistice in 1918. That he was such a prevalent figure in Sassoon’s life and suddenly disappeared upon his marriage to a woman is worth noting. Sassoon’s mention of that marriage is also interesting. It is rather curt, reading only “Robert Graves is married on Tuesday. Sent me his new poem ‘The God Poetry’ yesterday. Very fine.”[^23] The actual mention of the marriage of who seems to be his best friend is a mere six word sentence in the middle of a rather lengthy diary entry. Considering Graves’ ‘apologies’ for his engagement, joking or not, it is rather odd that Sassoon spends so little time discussing it. Graves was also a queer trench poet and it seems highly likely that they had some kind of relationship with each other. Sassoon mentions him a lot; by referencing his poetry, or mentioning a new letter he received, or expressing concerns about Graves’ stationing on the Front.

# Concluding thoughts

Sassoon struggled with his desire for solitude and more intellectual pursuits and the expected presentation of masculinity. He threw himself into gentlemanly pursuits, like fox-hunting, but it wasn’t until he “was in the army in France that the aesthete and the sportsman could happily co-exist; where anxieties about his homosexuality could be allayed by ‘manly’ heroism.”[^24] In the army he was able to combine the masculine, disciplined, strong man with the poetic, and likely in his mind, effeminate and weaker man through his relationships with the other men, his position as officer, and his writing. If the sportsman identity reflects a kind of homosociality, then the aesthete represents his homosexuality and it is Sassoon’s war poet status which finally allowed, if not self-acceptance, then a self existence. 

Even still, there was a tension. He wrote, “…I am never alone here – never my old self – always acting a part – that of the cheery, reckless sportsman…But the men love me, that’s one great consolation.”[^25] It is worth noting that this passage comes in mid July of 1916, nearly at the peak of Sassoon’s suicidal tendencies post Tommy’s death and while he is separated from Robert Graves. He struggles to reconcile the two halves of his nature, which he sees as completely disparate, even more so when he loses the man he loves. His queerness, his inner aesthete, is adrift. 

Siegfried’s Sassoon relationship with David Thomas provides insight into the gendered and queered interactions between officers and their men, between queer soldiers, between the self and the image one presents to the world. World War I disrupted masculinity by destabilizing the men who fought in it and simultaneously separating from the women they had constructed their gender in opposition to. The trenches, and the military more generally, are deeply homosocial spaces that, in some ways, encouraged and even promoted forming close bonds between men to become better adapted to the struggles of modern warfare. These bonds were often intimate and borderline romantic. Despite the deeply homophobic nature of both British society and military masculinity, queer men were nonetheless suddenly able to express their affection for men more openly. They may not have had much ability to actually act on their feelings with any clarity, but they nonetheless formed them. Sassoon was a deeply repressed man who was compelled by his friend Tommy’s physical attractiveness and the archetypal hopeful British youth, of which it is unclear whether Sassoon exaggerated or was the reality. The ways Sassoon expressed his love for Tommy were only allowed to come about in the specific ambiguity of the military as a homosocial and/or homosexual space.
