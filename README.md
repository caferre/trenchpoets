# Historical Background
Sexuality and gender in the First World War are often studied as it had incredibly destabilizing effects, especially on masculinity. A lack of men at home prompted women to enter the workforce beyond secretarial and white-collar jobs. Shell-shock, physical disabilities, and death prevented men from returning to their old lives after the war, and some soldiers held bitter resentment towards civilians, especially women, for lauding the image of a brave soldier from their relative safety at home. Husbands felt isolated and deeply changed, and wives found them unreachable. During the war, men were separated from their families and the kind of emotional support they had received, mostly from their wives, so they formed close bonds with other men in their squadrons. This need for connection allowed queer soldiers to express their love for their comrades with a level of ambiguity. Trench poets occupy a central role in the study of gender and sexuality in the First World War. Their often scathing notes on the war and horrific descriptions of what they saw have served to cement them in historical and literary analysis of this period. A not insignificant subsection of trench poets were also queer, and their lives provide insight into a queer world in early 20th century United Kingdom. Among these, Siegfried Sassoon is one of the most iconic.

## Existing literature on WWI, gender, and sexuality 
Existing scholarship has focused intensely on the destabilization of masculinity during the war. That World War I threw the traditional gender norms of many European countries into disarray is not a new concept. As early as the 1920s, in fact, members of the British public were concerned with the “painted boy,” queer men in London, “because he embodied particular historical fears and anxieties related to the experience of the First World War” which “emasculated and feminized” men. Homosexuality had been a concern to the British for centuries, with the earliest anti queer law being passed in 1533 as a statute against buggery, and the most recent one prior to the war written in 1898. Masculinity was a matter of concern during the war and later became a matter of interest, but it has always been a point of focus. Modern scholars have less worries about an effeminate male scourge and instead tend to examine what happened to masculinity and why. The study of queerness during World War I is also not a new concept, however, it is far younger than studies of gender. In the past thirty or so years, more and more work has been published on specifically the queerness of famous trench poets and how their poetry and personal writings reflect that. 

Jason Crouthamel is a significant scholar of queerness in WWI whose work does not focus only on either trench poets or Western European soldiers. His works on German soldiers are particularly helpful for their illumination of the social world of the trenches, and although they are about the opposing army, the observations of camaraderie and closeness as a response to the horrors they were experiencing can easily be applied to the British army as well. Adrian Caesar’s Taking it Like a Man explores the suffering, sacrifice, and sexuality of the war poets and is incredibly useful for studying how poets reconciled their more intellectual, aesthetic tendencies with the extreme violence they did every day. In a similar vein, James Campbell’s essay on the ethics of passivity details the gendered politics of a battalion, which formed largely around class, rank, and racial divisions. Despite being neither explicitly for historians nor about World War I, Eve Sedgwick’s writings on homosociality and homosocial desire are crucial for exploring queerness in the trenches. In her definition the word homosocial
       <blockquote>
       <p>“describes social bonds between persons of the same sex; it is a neologism, obviously formed by analogy with "homosexual," and just as obviously meant to be distinguished from "homosexual." In fact, it is applied to such activities as "male bonding," which may, as in our society, be characterized by intense homophobia, fear and hatred of homosexuality. To draw the "homosocial" back into the orbit of "desire," of the potentially erotic, then, is to hypothesize the potential unbrokenness of a continuum between homosocial and homosexual– a continuum whose visibility, for men, in our society, is radically disrupted.” </p>
       </blockquote>
This joining, or rejoining, of homosociality with desire, with eroticism– it is part and parcel with the work being done in World War I among queer and heterosexual soldiers alike.

## Sassoon and Tommy

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, 
dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[^1]
